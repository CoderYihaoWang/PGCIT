Challenge 01
==========
This challenge is worth **1%** of the final grade.

## Exercise One: Don't Use if Statement

### Sorting Numbers
Complete the method `sortNumbersByAscending()` in `SortNumbers.java`. The method takes four integers as arguments and then displays them sorted into ascending order. Later in the course you will learn efficient ways of doing this using built-in methods, but for now use only methods you have learned in the lectures. **Do not use if statements for this exercise.**

The skeleton code is found in `sortnumbers.SortNumbers.java`   

### Calculate Elapsed Time
Complete the method `getTimeElapsed()` found in `ElapsedTime.java`. The method takes a start time and a finish time, each of which is broken down into hours and minutes and expressed as integers, and then displays the time difference between the two in minutes. You should assume a 12 hour period and that the start time is always earlier than the finish time; for example if the start time was 5 hours 30 minutes and the finish time was 5 hours 29 minutes, then 11 hours and 59 minutes must have passed. **Do not use if statements for this exercise**.

The skeleton code is found in `elapsedtime.ElapsedTime.java`.
